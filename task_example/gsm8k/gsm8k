Question: For every 12 cans you recycle, you receive $0.50, and for every 5 kilograms of newspapers, you receive $1.50. If your family collected 144 cans and 20 kilograms of newspapers, how much money would you receive?
Answer: There are 144/12 = <<144/12=12>>12 sets of 12 cans that the family collected.
So, the family would receive $0.50 x 12 = $<<0.50*12=6>>6 for the cans.
There are 20/5 = <<20/5=4>>4 sets of 5 kilograms of newspapers that the family collected.
So, the family would receive $1.50 x 4 = $<<1.50*4=6>>6 for the newspapers.
Therefore, the family would receive a total of $6 + $6 = $<<6+6=12>>12.

Question: Betty picked 16 strawberries. Matthew picked 20 more strawberries than Betty and twice as many as Natalie. They used their strawberries to make jam. One jar of jam used 7 strawberries and they sold each jar at $4. How much money were they able to make from the strawberries they picked?
Answer: Matthew picked 16 + 20 = <<16+20=36>>36 strawberries.
Natalie picked 36/2 = <<36/2=18>>18 strawberries.
All together, they have 16 + 36 + 18 = <<16+36+18=70>>70 strawberries.
They can make 70/7 = <<70/7=10>>10 jars of strawberries.
They earn 10 x $4 = $<<10*4=40>>40 from the strawberries they picked.

Question: James dumps his whole collection of 500 Legos on the floor and starts building a castle out of them.  He uses half the pieces before finishing and is told to put the rest away.  He puts all of the leftover pieces back in the box they came from, except for 5 missing pieces that he can't find.  How many Legos are in the box at the end?
Answer: James starts with 500 Legos and uses half of them, leaving 500/2=<<500/2=250>>250 Legos unused.
He puts those unused Legos away but since he's missing 5 he only puts 250-5=<<250-5=245>>245 Legos away.
